# Realtime Chat App in Rust
This is a simple realtime chat app built in Rust. Credits to: [SergioBenitez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NS9Dh63i_Q4&t=320s).

To run the application, run ```cargo run``` at the root directory. The server will start at http://127.0.0.1:8000/. If you open 2 separate pages and send messages from 2 different users, you should be able to see messages being shown in the board instantly.
